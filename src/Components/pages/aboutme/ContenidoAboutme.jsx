                    I have always had an interest in informatics, which naturally led me to coding. As a result,
                    I’ve gained experience in various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, including Python, JS, C#, and C++.
                    (However, I would say that JS and C# are my main ones)

                    On the other hand, I am well-versed in libraries like React and frameworks such as Express.js (perhaps even a little too much, as switching back to plain JS
                    has become a mental exercise :b)

                <div className="Parrafo">
                    i am also experienced in version control using Git and hosting projects on platforms like GitHub Pages, where this porfolio is currently hosted.

                    Still, I have much to learn, and I make the most of every opportunity to do so.

                    Currently, I am in my third year of studying Systems Engineering at the UTN-FRC Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Facultad Regional Córdoba in Argentina
